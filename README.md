# 100daysOfCode

The purpose of this is to try to be coding and working on a project every day for 100 days and see how many projects I can complete starting with not knowing anything.

Day1 - created a counter project. Added the ability to change the color of the counter. I also created a grid to put other projects as I do my 100 day code challenge.
